  Digital Kaleidoscope is a lightweight app for Flipper Zero that transforms the device’s screen into a dynamic, ever-changing kaleidoscope. You get four unique visual styles, each with its own character:
  
  Rotating Star
  A radiating starburst spins slowly around the center of the display, giving the impression of a celestial dance.

  Concentric Arcs
  Pixelated semi-circles expand and contract in rings from the middle of the screen, creating a fluid, ripple-like effect.

  Gradient Noise
  Random noise pixels appear brightest at the center and fade toward the edges. The pattern shifts subtly over time, producing a mesmerizing “shifting haze.”

  Mirrored Dots
  A static cloud of random dots is mirrored left-to-right. Unlike the other styles, this one does not animate automatically—you press an arrow key to regenerate the dot pattern whenever you like.

 You can fine-tune how “busy” each style looks by adjusting the density (0–100%) with the Up/Down buttons. The Left/Right arrows switch between the four visualizers, and pressing Back returns you to the main menu. Styles 1–3 animate continuously (refreshing every ~100 ms), whereas Style 4 stays frozen until you manually redraw it.
